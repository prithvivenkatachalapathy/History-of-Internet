<div class="Title"><h1>The Invention Of The Internet</h1></div>

<div class="IOISummary"><p>
    <h2>Advanced Research Projects Agency (1957)</h2>
    President Eisenhower created the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) which was in charge of the Space Program
    and Computer Development. Eventually NASA took over the space program and ARPA became its own entity.<br> <br>

    <h2>Queueing Theory and Circuit Theory (1962)</h2>
    Leonard Kleinrock a PHD student at MIT proposed the concept of Queueing Theory which was based on packet switching
    which would be used for computer networks later on in the decade. Circuit Switching is a technology used where the
    circuit is first established between two points and then a message could be sent between those two points. However
    the US government realized that if the Soviet union would ever attack them it wouldn't withstand the war. So, the
    government pushed ARPA to come up with a solution to this problem, thus accelerating computer research.<br><br>

    <h2>The Necessity for Interconnected Networks (1966)</h2>
    Bob Taylor, an employee at ARPA, was using terminals to access computers; and realized that it was annoying to use a
    different terminal per computer and theorized that a single terminal could suffice to talk to multiple computers at
    once. He wanted Heterogeneous computers to communicate with one another across a network; he pitched the idea and
    received 1 million dollars in funding to do so.<br><br>

    <h2>Packet Switching and Lawrence Roberts (1968)</h2>
    Bob Taylor hired Lawrence Roberts, an MIT graduate to help build the ARPA computer network. They came up with
    something called Packet Switching which is when a message is cut into tiny bits and transmitted via a network and
    finds its way to the destination by itself and the receiving end reconstructs the message. The issue then was
    computers did not know how to talk to the other computers due to a language barrier.<br><br>

    <h2>Integrated Message Processors (1969)</h2>
    Interface Message Processors were developed, they were like a translator for each computer so that they could speak
    one unified language and communicate with one another, and BBN won the contract to produce them. UCLA students wrote
    code to allow the I.M.P to communicate with one another. By the end of 1969 the I.M.P arrived at UCLA and 4
    computers were connected on the network.<br><br>

    <h2>ARPANET (1971)</h2>
    Two years after the first network was established ARPANET had 18 mainframe computers connected to the network. A
    ‘killer’ application was also launched in 1971, Email. Ray Tomlinson of ARPA made the application and allowed people
    to communicate much quicker within the network, this was how ‘@’ symbol came into existence.<br><br>

    <h2>TCP/IP Protocols (1973)</h2>
    Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn developed the TCP/IP protocol, which set the standard that allowed for networks to
    interconnect. They develop a central computer, called a gateway, to know the protocol and communicate across
    networks.<br><br>

    <h2>Access to Internet (1992)</h2>
    Tim-Berners Lee invented the World Wide Web which used HTTPS and allowed users to switch from one website to
    another.The internet grew vastly with more advancements in computing technology like the mouse; desktop pc and the
    high-speed modem.<br><br>


    <h2>Internet Revolution and Adoption (1993)</h2>
    Marc Andreason created the first browser Mosaic at the University of Illinois that allowed users to get graphically
    rich content in an easy to use; point and click format.. Mosaic was later commercialized at Netscape. Due to this
    advancement the internet grew 341,000%. <br><br>
