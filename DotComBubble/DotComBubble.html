     <div class="DCBSummary"><p>As shopping was one of the most common things between everyone, the age of E-Commerce became the new phase of capitalism. Amazon and eBay created a whole new model of E-Commerce. Two important technologies and laws paired with them drove the growth of the internet. First was  the silicon chip, governed by Moore's law. The law predicted that the capability of a computer will increase every couple of years. Hence, the number of the transistors on a microchip should double every 18 months. Second one was the Metcalfeâ€™s Law, which said that everytime a new computer was added to the network, it added even more connections. As the numbers of these connections increase, the usefulness of the network increases. It also would attract more users.<br>
         <h2>Secured E-Commerce</h2><br>
    It was crucial to make the transactions and personal information shared on these websites secure as the business grew. This is when Public Key Cryptography was developed by Ralph Merkel. Whitfield Diffie, and Martin Hellman. Over time, E-Commerce became a common thing for anyone with access to the internet. DotCom became a trend. This impacted the stock market a lot. The dotcom boom was a bubble, but it however came to an end when it crashed in 2000& 2001. Although some companies failed, there were many that thrived. Amazon and eBay set an example by being the most established E-commerce companies. They cared about their customers more than profits, and it is what helped them grow.
