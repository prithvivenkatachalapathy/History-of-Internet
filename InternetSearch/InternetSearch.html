     <div class="IOISummary"><h2>Yahoo & Excite</h2><p>This particular is based on the time before google. It talks about the story behind Yahoo and Excite. John Heilemann interviews two men who used to be students at Stanford University in California. These students are Jerry Yang and David Filo, who were Electrical engineering students. While they were trying to find a simple way to win the Stanford fantasy basketball league by using the internet. All they were trying to do was find updated information on the sports, so they can use it to gain a win. During all this research, they realise that a directory would make it a lot easier to use the internet, especially for people who are not experts. This directory just included categories and subcategories. It was called “ David and Jerry’s Guide to the World Wide Web”. This provided the new users of the web, a helping hand. They changed the name of the browser to Yahoo.  They found the investor, Michael Moritz, who was a venture capitalist. Although it was a useful resource for many people, they needed a way to actually make money off of it. Hence, they started selling advertisements. Jerry and David were skeptical about it because there was a possibility of the users not liking the concept. Excite was also another browser that became a competition. It had a more sophisticated software and was also made by students from Stanford. </p>
     <br><br>
     <h2>Google</h2><p>Over time Yahoo and Excite started losing the sight of the primary goal of guiding new users with browsing. As people were starting to lose their faith from the search engines, two Stanford students became a light in the dark. They launched a search engine under the stanford website. As time passed, the popularity of google started overpowering the Stanford website, and it was forced off campus. Larry and David found an investor, who recognised the potential in their idea, through a Stanford professor. While google started to climb the ladder of success, there was an individual in LA creating history without even knowing. Bill Gross came up with the idea of selling key words to the companies. This would help companies understand what is being searched by their users most and provide a personalized experience. As appreciative as google was of this brilliant idea, it decided to come up with a similar concept with a minor tweak. This led to a legal battle which was eventually resolved through a financial settlement.  Google continued providing a better user experience. The success of Google led to the launch of Google book search, Google docs, Google  maps, Picasa, Google earth, Gmail, Google calendar, buying of YouTube, etc. As the usage of Google search engine, people started getting concerned about privacy. The government even asked for a copy of the data Google had, but got turned down. Although, there was some hesitation, it was undeniable that Google was the most resourceful search engine and the fasted rising company of the time.  </p>
